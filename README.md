```

**Solution Organization:**
- All 4 projects are contained in a single unified solution file
- Projects are organized by dependency hierarchy (Shared → API → Client → Tests)
- Test project references both API and Shared projects

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "D424 Capstone"
```

### 2. Open the Solution

Open `StudentProgressTracker.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.

**Note:** This is the unified solution file containing all 4 projects:
- StudentLifeTracker.Shared (DTOs library)
- StudentLifeTracker.API (Web API)
- StudentProgressTracker (MAUI Client)
- StudentProgressTracker.Tests (Test project)

### 3. Restore NuGet Packages

```bash
dotnet restore StudentProgressTracker.sln
```

Or restore from Visual Studio:
- Right-click the solution → **Restore NuGet Packages**

### 4. Configure the API

#### Database Connection

Edit `StudentLifeTracker.API/appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=StudentLifeTrackerDb;Trusted_Connection=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}
```

For production, use a full SQL Server connection string:
```json
"DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server;Database=StudentLifeTrackerDb;User Id=your-user;Password=your-password;"
```

#### JWT Settings

Update JWT configuration in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "JwtSettings": {
    "SecretKey": "YourSuperSecretKeyForJWTTokenGenerationMustBeAtLeast32CharactersLong!",
    "Issuer": "StudentLifeTracker",
    "Audience": "StudentLifeTracker",
    "ExpirationInMinutes": 60,
    "RefreshTokenExpirationInDays": 7
  }
}
```

**Important:** Change the `SecretKey` to a secure random string in production!

### 5. Configure the Client

The client is configured to use the Azure-hosted API by default:

```csharp
private readonly string _baseUrl = "https://spt-api-v2-defjczgvg9bgbcaw.eastus2-01.azurewebsites.net";
```

For local development, you can change this to:
```csharp
private readonly string _baseUrl = "https://localhost:7119"; // Local development
```

### 6. Initialize the Database

The API will automatically create the database on first run using `EnsureCreated()`. For production, use Entity Framework migrations:

```bash
cd StudentLifeTracker.API
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Open the Solution

1. Open `StudentProgressTracker.sln` in Visual Studio
   - **Note:** This is the unified solution file containing all 4 projects

2. Verify all projects load correctly in Solution Explorer

### Step 2: Start the API

1. Set `StudentLifeTracker.API` as the startup project
2. Press F5 or click **Run**
3. The API will start on `https://localhost:7119` (or the port configured in `launchSettings.json`)
4. Swagger UI will be available at `https://localhost:7119/swagger`

### Step 3: Run the Client Application

1. Set `StudentProgressTracker` as the startup project
2. Select your target platform:
   - **Windows Machine** - for Windows desktop
